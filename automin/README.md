# AutoMin

An ExpressionEngine module and extension that automates the combination and compression of your source files. Currently supports CSS, JavaScript, LESS, and HTML compression.

AutoMin is smart enough to know when you've changed your source files and will automatically regenerate it's cache when appropriate.

## Requirements

ExpressionEngine v3+

*Compatible with EE v3-5*

## Installation

**EE v3-5:**

1. Copy `automin` directory into `/system/user/addons/`
2. Create the AutoMin cache directory somewhere below your document root. Make sure it is writable by Apache.
3. In ExpressionEngine, navigate to `Developer -> Add-On Manager`. Click `Install` next to AutoMin.
4. In the settings page for AutoMin, enter the server path and url to your AutoMin cache directory. Be sure to enable `AutoMin` and `Caching`. All of these options may be overridden in your config file.
5. Add the AutoMin template tags to your ExpressionEngine templates. I recommend that you either separate your CSS and JS into an embed template that isn't cached as it will prevent EE from caching AutoMin's output, which can prevent AutoMin from noticing when you change your source code.
6. Refresh your site. If all goes well, you'll see your CSS and JS code combined and compressed. See the template debugger for error messages. **Note:** the first page load after changing your source files or the AutoMin template tags could take longer than usual while your code is compressed.


## Usage

Currently, you may not combine LESS code with normal CSS code. Use two separate AutoMin tags to compile both CSS and LESS.

**Compiling LESS:** If you use AutoMin to compile your LESS source files, you DO NOT need to include the less.js parser file. AutoMin will parse your LESS source file and then compress the CSS output before sending it to your browser.

### JavaScript Caching

	{exp:automin:js
		attribute:type="text/javascript"
	}
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.ui.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.ui.mouse.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.ui.position.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.ui.widget.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.ui.draggable.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.regex.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.regex.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/cufon.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/global.js"></script>
	{/exp:automin:js}

### CSS Caching

	{exp:automin:css
		attribute:type="text/css"
		attribute:title="default"
		attribute:rel="stylesheet"
		attribute:media="screen, projection"
	}
		<link href="/css/core.css" type="text/css" title="default" rel="stylesheet" media="screen, projection">
		<link href="/css/design.css" type="text/css" title="default" rel="stylesheet" media="screen, projection">
	{/exp:automin:css}

### LESS Caching

	{exp:automin:less
		attribute:type="text/css"
		attribute:title="default"
		attribute:rel="stylesheet"
		attribute:media="screen, projection"
	}
		<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="/css/styles.less">
	{/exp:automin:less}


### Parameters

Any parameter that you specify beginning with `attribute:` will be included as an attribute to the resulting HTML tag that AutoMin produces. Take the examples below,
for instance:

This tag:

`{exp:automin:js attribute:type="text/javascript"}`

Outputs something similar to:

`<script src="/automin/7dc66e1b2104b40a9992a3652583f509.js?modified=8832678882928" type="text/javascript"></script>`

And this tag:

`{exp:automin:css attribute:type="text/css" attribute:title="default" attribute:rel="stylesheet" attribute:media="screen, projection"}`

Outputs something similar to:

`<link href="/automin/55ed34446f3eac6f869f3fe5b375d311.css?modified=8832678882928" type="text/css" title="default" rel="stylesheet" media="screen, projection">`

### Variables

There are no variables for AutoMin. Anything inside the tag pair will be replaced with the final output.

### Config Overrides

Any option that is set in AutoMin's settings page can be overriden in your config file like so:

	// Automin Config Overrides
	$config['automin_automin_enabled'] = 'y';
	$config['automin_compress_html']   = 'y';
	$config['automin_caching_enabled'] = 'y';
	$config['automin_cache_path']      = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/automin/';
	$config['automin_cache_url']       = '/automin/';

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. Turn on template debugging in `Settings -> General Setting -> Debugging & Output` to view detailed log messages. When reporting issues, please include your template log.
2. Make sure your cache directory is set in the module's settings and that the directory is writeable by PHP. In most cases, you'll need to assign that directory writable permissions for Apache.
3. If AutoMin breaks your CSS or JS code, make sure that your code contains no syntax errors. In your JS, you need to make sure that you always terminate JS statements with a semi-colon. Try running your source code through the relevant lint program for a validity check.
4. Make sure that your CSS images are web-root relative. Use URLs like: `url('/css/img/myimage.jpg')` instead of `url('img/myimage.jpg')`

### 2.1.4

- Fixed Deprecation notice #27 for optimal compatibility with versions >= 2.6. 

### 2.1.3

- Fixed Bug #23. Updated LessPHP to support the latest version of Twitter Bootsrap.

### 2.1.2

 - Fixed Bug #10. When compiling less, the .less extension is no longer given to the cache file.

### 2.1 - Please read carefully!

 - A general rewrite of the code was done to improve performance and make room for new features that are in the works. Please read these notes prior to upgrading!
 - Relative file paths are now supported in both your markup and in CSS @imports. You should still use document-root relative paths in your CSS files as those paths are **NOT** rewritten.
 - Tag attributes have changed. You must now prefix the attributes you want to be passed along to AutoMin's output with the string `attribute:`. Here's an example: `{exp:automin:js attribute:type="text/javascript"}`
 - Config overrides have changed. Please see the notes below. The old config overrides will continue to work, but it is recommended that you go ahead and update your config file now.
 - Fixed Bug #6. Multiple sites are now supported.
 - Fixed Bug #7. Config overrides are now reflected in the CP.
 - Fixed Bug #8. Less now parses @import statements. Bootstrap is now supported.
 - Added Feature Request #4. Markup compression no longer requires the CodeIgniter hook. Thanks to a nifty new extension hook in EE 2.4. Please remove the `automin.php` file from your `system/expressionengine/hooks` directory and remove the AutoMin line from your `system/expressionengine/config/hooks.php` file. Requires ExpressionEngine 2.4+.
 - If you experience any funkyness after updating AutoMin to v2.1, try the following: 1) Uninstall and then re-install the module and extension. 2) Make sure you've changed your template tags to use the new attribute syntax. 3) Make sure your CSS and JS pass lint without any errors. 4) Check the template log for any errors processing your template tags.

### 2.0

 - Added support for LESS compilation! Updated the CSS and JS compression classes.
 - Added ability to override AutoMin's configuration options in the config.php file.
 - Refactored function names to adhere to EllisLab coding guidelines.
 - Removed an unnecessary file read when returning cached data. When returning compiled source code, the timestamp of the latest-modified file is appended to the compiled source file so that browsers will cache files as long as possible---but not too long.
